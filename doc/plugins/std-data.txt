Description:
	This plugin is responsible for handling all files that would go to the base "data/" folder.
	That include maps and other files.
	
	This plugin uses a special algorithm to mix the files based on the difference between them and the default file.
	So don't worry in putting many files of the same type for the loader to handle.
	For example, 5 handling.cfg files will be mixed based on which line changes between it and the default file, etc.
	
    Currently it can handle the following files:
        *.ide
        *.ipl
        default.dat / gta.dat
        handling.cfg
        carmods.dat
        plants.dat
	    
    And the following without mixing but overriding:
        timecyc.dat
        popcycle.dat
	    tracks%d.dat
	    roadblox.dat
	    fonts.dat

	It also can detect lines from the following files in a readme text file:
        gta.dat
        vehicles.ide
	    veh_mods.ide
	    handling.cfg
	    carmods.dat

Usage:

    For ide and ipl files, they must be together a gta.dat file (or a gta.dat line in a text file)
    and they must be inside the folder the gta.dat requests it to be.
    
    For example, if the gta.dat file says the IPL file is at:
        IPL data/maps/mymap/map.IPL
        
    Inside modloader the IPL files must be in a place something like:
        modloader/mymod/data/maps/mymap/map.IPL
        or even
        modloader/mymod/folder1/folder2/folder3/data/maps/mymap/map.IPL
    
    That applies to IDE files too.
    
    For other files, such as handling.cfg, just place the file wherever you want (of course inside a mod folder)
    Remember, it can detect lines from readme (.txt) files.
