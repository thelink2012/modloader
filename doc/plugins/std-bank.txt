Description:
    The standard bank loader handles SFX files (such as GENRL, BankLkup.dat, etc).
    It can also load wave files directly from disk.

Usage:
    The usage is a bit more complicated than other cases.
    
    To replace a sound with a .wav file you need to have a folder structure like this:
        SFXPAK_FOLDER/BANK_%d/SOUND_%d.wav
    or just
        BANK_%d/SOUND_%d.wav
        In this case SFXPAK_FOLDER will be assumed as GENRL
    Where SFXPAK_FOLDER is a folder with the same name as a SFXPak file (GENRL, FEET, SPC_GA, etc)
    
    An actual example that loads a wave instead of the standard sound at GENRL/BANK_001/sound_001:
        modloader/aaaa/GENRL/BANK_001/sound_001.wav
    
    It can also override the loading of the following files:
        BankLkup.dat
        BankSlot.dat
        EventVol.dat
        PakFiles.dat
        Original SFXPaks (GENRL, FEET, SPC_GA, SCRIPT, etc)
        Anything without extension inside a SFX/ folder will be detected as a SFXPak
