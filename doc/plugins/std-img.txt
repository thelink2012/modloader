Description:
	The standard IMG loader is the standard plugin for loading IMG files data in modloader.
	It can load all formats a normal IMG can, that is: dff, txd, col, ipl, dat, ifp, rrr, scm.
	It can also handle a img folder, that is, everything inside an "folder.img" folder will be handled as img files.

Usage:
	First way:  Just place your files (see list of supported formats) in the mod folder.
	Second way: Optionally you can create a folder with the extension img (example: "folder.img") and place your files inside it.
	
	By using the first way, other plugins can handle the file too, providing extensibility.
	By using the second way, only this plugin will handle the files inside the folder.
	The first way is recommended.
	
	Additionally it replaces the standard img files if they're placed in their respective equivalent folders.
	So, for example, to replace "models/gta3.img" you should have "modloader/mymod/models/gta3.img"
	
	It also has integration with img files loaded from gta.dat/default.dat files ("IMG" command).
	If you place any .img file in the mod folder (example: "modloader/mymod/data/script/script.img")
	that has a loading line in the .dat files (yes, script.img does), your file will be loaded instead.

NEEDS:
	[*] Testing, mainly with RRR and SCM files
