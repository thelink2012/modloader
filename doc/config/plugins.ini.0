[PRIORITY]

; Define plugins priority here
; The priority must be from 1 to 100, where 100 has the highest and 1 has the lowest priority
; The priority 0 means "DO NOT LOAD"
; Standard plugins normally have priorities in the range 45-55
; Just put the plugin module name here, example: std-text.dll=50
